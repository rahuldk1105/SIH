1.This Project is about creating an app that allows Farmers to connect with the market directly without the interference of middle-men.
2.This App helps the farmers to list their produce, negotiate prices directly with the consumers and Retailers, enabling them to sell their produce at a fair price in the direct market.
3.This app provides two interfaces, one for Farmers, and the other for Market Interface, so that farmers will not face difficulties in selling their produce or buying any essential materials.
4.Another aim of this app is to enable smooth online transactions between farmers and buyers and/or people who sell essential products like seeds, fertilizers, manure, etc.
